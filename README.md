## Description

jsoup (v 1.11.2) is a library for extracting real-world HTML data using DOM, CSS and jquery-like methods. A copy of the version of the source code known to work for this assignment is available here

Links to an external site.; you can also use git clone https://github.com/jhy/jsoup.git. It involves about 18,000 lines of code spread over 60 files. This program is a bit small for this course, but comes with a rich existing test suite. This existing test suite will serve as a baseline for comparison.

The associated test input (and oracle!) generation tool is EvoSuite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EvoSuite), version 1.0.5. Mirror copies of evosuite-1.0.5.jar and evosuite-standalone-runtime-1.0.5.jar are available, but you should visit the project webpage for documentation.

EvoSuite generates unit tests (cf. JUnit) for Java programs.
